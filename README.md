# turtle-racing-py
A small, procedural turtle racing game that utilizes the Python programming language

## Modules used
This program utilizes a couple of modules that are built into the standard Python library and do not require any oustide installations:
  1. __turtle__: turtle was the main module that was used for this program. It was used to build the screen/canvas, create our racers, shape our racers as turtles, color our racers, and properly position and space the racers on the screen
  2. __random__: random was used to randomly rearrange a list of colors for each new game, that way, the colors were not always the same
